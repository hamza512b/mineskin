# Mineskin â€“ Minecraft Skin Editor and Preview Tool

This is a project and tool for testing and editing Minecraft skins. The tool has gone through many iterations over the years. It is now completely free and open-source under the MIT license.

## Technical Information

I initially used Three.js to build the website, but later wanted to learn more about 3D graphics and the WebGL API. So I rewrote the project using plain WebGL calls, without any libraries. I also added some abstractions to make the code more readable.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
