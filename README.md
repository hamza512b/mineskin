# Minskin â€“ Minecraft Skin Tester

Minecraft skin which always looks at the cursor. The skin can be replaced with a
skin of your own, but it has to be version 1.8+. Meaning it has to 64px in width
and height. There is also no support yet for multilayer skins, open issue \([\#1](https://github.com/hamzakhuswan/minskin/issues/1)\).

This website is still under development and help like suggestions, issues or
contributions is appreciated.

## Background

This is was an old repo, I created it while ago. I did this project just because
I wanted to do something in 3d. But now after an update, this started getting
some attention. Because of these reddit posts:

[first subreddit \(Blender
community\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/kcas9j/using_blender_and_little_bit_of_code_i_done_this/)

[second subreddit \(Minecraft
community\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kck7c4/i_made_this_minecraft_skin_tester_still_under/)

## Technical information

I used Blender to create the mesh.

ThreeJS (WebGl library)

The website is compiled, developed, and built for production using Webpack
template (my own template).
