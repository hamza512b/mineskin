a lot of iterations accross the years. Now the project completly free and open sourced under the MIT license.

## Technical information

I intially used three.js to create the website. But than I wanted at some point to learn more about 3d graphics and Webgl api. I did redid the project in plain Webgl calls. No libraries are used. I tried to create abstraction and make the code more readable.
